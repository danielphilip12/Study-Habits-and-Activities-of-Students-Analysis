# Study-Habits-and-Activities-of-Students-Analysis

## Project Goal

This project is about finding the balance between study time and personal time to be able to achieve high GPA, while still having a relatively low stress life. 

I think this is a good dataset to do an analysis on because I believe that the amount of pressure we put on students to be constantly studying is actually deterimental to their grades and stress levels. Despite the pressure to be studying all the hours of the day, I believe that the benefits of getting good grades are outweighed by the consequences of being highly stressed and anti-social. Stress will ultimately lead to burnout, causing a loss in motivation and potentially depression. We can use this dataset to find the balance between studying, extracirriculars, sleeping, socializing, etc. to get good grades and relatively low stress levels.

## Todo
- Make Subsets of the Data
- Find relationships between the different areas of the data
- Convert the csv file into a sql database
- write some scripts for the sql to look at subsets.
