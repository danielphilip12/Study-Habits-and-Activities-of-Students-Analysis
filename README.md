# Study-Habits-and-Activities-of-Students-Analysis



## Problem Statement

- This dataset contains information about how students spend their day, their GPA, and their stress level. Many students suffer from having high stress, which is deterimental to their mental health, and we as a society seem to encourge this kind of behavior to acheive good marks. However, I believe that the consequences of having a high stress school life outweigh the benefits of having good grades. 

- This project is about finding the balance between study time and personal time to be able to achieve high GPA, while still having a relatively low stress life.

#### Old Project Statement 
I think this is a good dataset to do an analysis on because I believe that the amount of pressure we put on students to be constantly studying is actually deterimental to their grades and stress levels. Despite the pressure to be studying all the hours of the day, I believe that the benefits of getting good grades are outweighed by the consequences of being highly stressed and anti-social. Stress will ultimately lead to burnout, causing a loss in motivation and potentially depression. We can use this dataset to find the balance between studying, extracirriculars, sleeping, socializing, etc. to get good grades and relatively low stress levels.

My goal for this project is to find the balance between getting a good GPA, while also keeping stress levels relatively low. 
This dataset has information about study hours, sleep hours, extracurricular hours, social hours, and physical activity hours per day, as well as their GPA and Stress Level (low, moderate, high). Using these features, I would like to find the balance of each of these daily hours to find what makes a good GPA, but also has a low to moderate stress level. 
The purpose of this would be to find a way to make sure students remain mentally healthy, while also making sure they do well in school.
